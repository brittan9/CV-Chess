Our initial goal was to be able to take video with a mobile device of someone shooting hoops and determine both the angle of their shot and whether it makes it into the hoop or not. We added some constraints to this problem by limiting the use case to hoops with a net, videos shot perpendicular to the player and the hoop, as well as requiring stable footage. Knowing the shot angle is helpful for players of all levels of experience, from beginner to professional. Many people have analyzed the physics behind a basketball shot and determined the \"optimal\" angle for release and entry - one source reported between 35 and 55 degrees depending on player height and shot distance. While it's not a one-fits-all approach, the release angle does directly impact the outcome, and thus it's good to know when analzying your performance and consistency."})]}),Object(y.jsx)("h2",{children:"Implementation"}),Object(y.jsx)("h4",{children:"Data Collection and Prep"}),Object(y.jsx)("p",{children:"In order to detect the basketball hoop in our video, we needed to train a neural net by providing as many images of hoops as we could reasonably find.

Because of this, we padded out the rest of our dataset with images found online. We got a variety of images containing empty courts or people playing, indoor or outdoor courts, and a variety of different looking basketball hoops and nets (we required there to be a net for our purposes).

We ended up foregoing these approaches for a few reasons. Firstly, if we used the pretrained yolov5 we didn't think that sportsball represented what we were trying to detect as much as a custom dataset could. Secondly, if we chose to create a custom dataset we didn't think we would have enough data to create a representive group of basketballs of different styles in various environments (different lighting, position, etc).

Another thing we would want to be able to do is take video from any location on the court instead of needing to be perpendicular to the shot - this could be achieved using a translation and mapping to 2D space, or alternatively could be done by using a 3D trajectory formula if you can determine the precise player location on the court (potentially using homographies). Additionally, for usability we really want users to be able to have shot analysis run directly on their mobile device instaed of needing to upload to a laptop or home computer.
